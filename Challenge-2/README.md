## Consolidation II, Rock-Paper-Scissors (Day 25)

### Day 25 (Challenge 2)
- Used Stacks (VStack, HStack, VStack)
- Used @State binding properties
- Custom ViewModifier and an extension for it 
- View Composition and Alert Message

### Thoughts process 
- Create necessary properties to store
  1. user's selection 
  2. computer's selection 
  3. game status
  4. game score
  5. game count 
- Make sure the binding works i.e. clicking the buttons on the screen gives the expected outcome of user's selection 
- Work on game logic and show the correct outcome on the game screen 
- Add colors and designs to the application 
- Combine the same modifier into a custom view modifier and add an extension 
- Add a start and restart game logic and conditional statement to hide the main game screen
- Remove the number of games limit and separate game score into three parts
  1. win count 
  2. loss count 
  3. tie count 
- Add an alert message 
- Brush up the designs, colors and clean up the code
