## Project 2, Guess the Flag (Day 20 - Day 22)

### Day 20 (Part 1)
Things I learned 
- The properties of Stacks (VStack, HStack, ZStack)
- The uses of Colors, Frames, and Gradients (Linear, RadialGradient, AngularGradient)
- The fundamentals of Images, Buttons and Alert Messages

### Day 21 (Part 2) 
- Continue building the app and improving the design of the app

### Day 22 (Part 3) 
Wrap-up Day Challenges 
- Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.
- When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
- Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.

To-Do
- [ ] Add more countires to the list 
- [ ] Change the layout i.e. put four flags into a 2x2 grid
